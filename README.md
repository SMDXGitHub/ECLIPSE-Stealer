### ❗❗Request❗❗

__Don't upload builded stealer to Virustotal__. The more often you upload it, the more and faster antiviruses begin to recognize its signature.

---
### 🔨Builder

__You will need to download Python 3.0 or above. You can download Python [here]([https://www.python.org/downloads/])
After that run the .bat file to assemble the Builder. Next, you will need to set-up a Discord webhook. You can learn how to do it right [here]([https://youtu.be/fKksxz2Gdnc]) Paste the webhook inside and choose your .ico and bot name. (Webhook can be changed in "configure" but you will need to build a new stub!)__
